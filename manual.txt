Added means of exiting the program by typing "exit" when propted to enter dice type.

This is a simple dice roller that allows you to roll any number of D2, D3, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, and D100 dice that you wish. 
It is not coded optimally, I am just practicing while I learn! This specifically was to test variables, functions, loops, etc.
And yes I put it in an infinite loop on purpose! It's fine!
